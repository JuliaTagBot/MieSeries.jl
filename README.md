# MieSeries

Tools to solve scattering and transmission by spherical objects using a series expansion in spherical harmonics. Examples for several acoustics and electromagnetic problems will be included.

**Note** This package works with under the convention that

```math
a(t) = Re(a*e^{-iÏ‰t})
```
